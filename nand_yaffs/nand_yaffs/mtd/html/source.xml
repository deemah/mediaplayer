<h2>CVS vs. Linux 2.6.x</h2>
<p>CVS contains development versions of the code which is in
Linux 2.6. Latest bugfixes show usually up in CVS before going
into mainline. Development only code like JFFS3 is in the CVS too.</p>

<hr size="2" />

<h2>Download and CVS</h2>
<p>Your best option is to obtain the latest code from CVS, by following 
the instructions below. We do break the CVS build occasionally, but we're 
also fairly good at fixing it quickly when we do so. </p>

<p>Anonymous CVS access is available, and full CVS access may also be
granted to developers on request.<br />
<i>cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.infradead.org:/home/cvs login (password: anoncvs)</i><br />
<i>cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.infradead.org:/home/cvs co mtd</i><br />
</p>

<p>If you can't access anoncvs for some reason, daily snapshots 
are also available at <a href="ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/people/dwmw2/mtd/cvs/">
				ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/people/dwmw2/mtd/cvs/</a>

<h2><a name="kernelversions">Kernel versions</a></h2>
<p>The MTD code in the linux kernel is updated from MTD CVS in kernel version <b>2.6.newest only</b>.</p>
<p>As of March 2005 we dropped Linux 2.4 support from CVS head. This means we not longer care
whether the CVS code can be used on Linux 2.4 or not. We will remove the compability hacks in the course of
time <b>without further notice</b> - especially when they are in the way of adding new functionality.</p>
<p>The latest snapshot which apparently works with 2.4 kernels >= 2.4.27 is 
<a href="ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/people/dwmw2/mtd/cvs/mtd-snapshot-20050304.tar.bz2">here</a>
</p>
<p>The MTD community is neither able nor interested to provide support for ancient kernels. 
Move yourself and update to a recent kernel. If you use a vendor supplied kernel, 
please  get support from your kernel vendor.  Do not ask on the mailinglist for help with 
 such problems. You are either ignored or you get a pointer to this text. 
Please save the bandwidth and our time to sort out such questions.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Check out sources from CVS or download a snapshot and untar it. Change to the
top directory and read INSTALL. Invoke patchkernel.sh from the top directory.
You have at least to supply the directory of the kernel you want to
patch. Command line options for various patch selections are available.
Invoke the script without arguments for help.<br />
This script applies all the neccecary changes to your kernel source
The script takes following options: <br />
<i>
-c copy files into kernel tree instead of linking files<br />
-2 include jffs2 filesystem<br />
-3 include jffs3 filesystem<br />
-y answer all questions with yes<br />
</i>
As last argument you have to give the path of your kernel tree. This must be an absolute
path.</p>
<p>The difference between linking and copying files into the kernel tree is, that copying 
       gives you a modified kernel tree, which can be handled by CVS as it contains no symlinks.
       Linking the files has two advantages. <br />
       1. All your kernel trees can share the same MTD source.<br />
       2. You can have more than one MTD source eg. a stable and an unstable and use it with
       your kernel tree(s) by changing the link to the directories.
       Assumed you have two MTD versions (stable and unstable) and those are located in source,
       then the directory listing of source shows:<br />
       <i>
       mtd->/source/mtd.stable<br />
       mtd.stable<br />
       mtd.unstable<br />
       </i>
       If you want to build with your stable MTD source, set the mtd link to mtd.stable else to 
       mtd.unstable. Don't forget to make clean, if you switch the links.
