This is the start of the klibc project.

Initially it is based on dietLibc <http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/> but will
probably grow to look quite different from that package.

Goals:
  To provide a small libc that can be used to build userspace binaries that
  will run in the initramfs portion of the kernel boot process.


Only library calls that are _needed_ will be added to klibc.  Right now only the 
calls needed to build and run dietHotplug are present.  Any functions that 
are must have a real need (i.e. some program needs them.)  We aren't going for
POSIX compliance here.

Right now a static library, klibc.a will be built.  If a dynamic library is
found to be needed that functionality will be added.


For this first release, I quickly hacked up what I had done for the dietHotplug
project.  It probably does not build on other architectures, and is probably
missing some functions that you want/need.  Please let me know any problems
that you find, and patches are gladly accepted.
