A tiny binary version of /sbin/hotplug

--------------------------------

Q: Why, what's wrong with the current linux-hotplug bash scripts?

A: Nothing.  This program is not a replacement for those scripts.  They
   work quite well in a general purpose environment.  This program is
   useful for systems that do not have their kernel changed on them,
   and have space requirements.  For instance, the upcoming 2.5 kernel
   initrd method, or embedded systems.

Q: What's with the dietlibc code?

A: The library files needed to build the hotplug program are now
   included in the release.  This removes the external dependancy on
   dietlibc, and allows everyone to build the smallest possible version
   of hotplug.

How to build:
--------------

	make KERNEL_INCLUDE_DIR=<where your kernel include dir is>

This program builds in the modules.pcimap and modules.usbmap from the
kernel version that you tell it to.  So it needs to know where the
kernel source tree is.

Useful things you can do:

To enable debugging so you can see what is going on in the syslog
uncomment the comment in the line:
#DEBUG = y
in the Makefile
